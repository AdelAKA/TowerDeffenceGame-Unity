# TowerDeffenceGame-Unity
The game is made by following a tutorial on a youtube chanel, made by the one and only <a href=https://www.youtube.com/Brackeys >Brackeys</a>.

I made my own version of the game by making some adjustments to the controls and some of the concepts in the game such as:
  - Camera movement
  - The upgrade system
  - Added range view for Turrets
  - Some bouncing animation for the enemies movement
  - Some extra effects for enemies
  - Made the game as endless mode with the difficulty increasing the more you go through waves
  - Added some background soundtracks
